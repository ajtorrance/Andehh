##Project Question##
<b>What is the question you hope to answer?</b>
Can we predict the number of bias crimes in a city tracked by the Human Rights Campaign given the Human Rights Campaign's city grading rubric?<br></br>

<b>Corollary questions</b>
What facets of the HRC's grading rubric best relate to mitigating bias crimes, and which facets are least correlated?  Are there any regional subgroups that relate more closely than others?<br></br>

<b>What data are you planning to use to answer that question?</b>
The HRC produces an annual report of 292 cities in the United States that examines xxxxx.  I have found a python script posted to github that scrapes the information from the HRC website and creates CSV files of all the information.
