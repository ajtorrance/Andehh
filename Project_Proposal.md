##Project Question##<br></br>
<b>What is the question you hope to answer?</b>
Can we predict the number of bias crimes in a city tracked by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) given the HRC's Municipal Equality Index, city grading rubric?  <br></br>

<b>Corollary questions:</b>
What facets of the HRC's grading rubric best relate to mitigating bias crimes, and which facets are least correlated?  Are there any regional subgroups that relate more closely than others?  The Human Rights Campaign divides its grading rubric into two scoring groups, one examining sexual orientation and one examining gender identity.  Is the grading rubric for either of these better at predicting bias crimes than the other?<br></br>

<b>What data are you planning to use to answer that question?</b>
The HRC produces an annual report of 292 cities in the United States that examines how inclusive a city is given its non-discrimination laws, qualitative aspects of law enforcement, the municipality's treatment of employees, and the city's public position on equality.  I have found a python script posted to github that scrapes the information from the HRC website and creates CSV files of all the information.  The FBI and Department of Justice are required to publish data of bias crimes annually which is currently available through the year of 2015.
